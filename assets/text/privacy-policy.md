# VTVL - PRIVACY POLICY

We recognise our responsibilities in relation to the collection, holding, processing, use and/or transfer of personal data. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us.

This policy (the “**Policy**”) outlines how we collect, use, store and disclose your personal data. Please take a moment to read about how we collect, use and/or disclose your personal data so that you know and understand the purposes for which we may collect, use and/or disclose your personal data. By accessing the Website, the Platform and/or the Services, you agree and consent to Andromeda Tech Pte. Ltd. (the “**Company**”), its related corporations, business units and affiliates, as well as their respective representatives and/or agents (collectively referred to herein as “**Andromeda**”, “**us**”, “**we**” or “**our**”), collecting, using, disclosing and sharing amongst themselves the personal data, and to disclosing such personal data to relevant third party providers. This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consent which you may have previously provided to us nor does it affect any rights that we may have at law in connection with the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal data. We may from time to time update this Policy to ensure that this Policy is consistent with our future developments, industry trends and/or any changes in legal or regulatory requirements. Subject to your rights at law, the prevailing terms of this Policy shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy forms part of the terms and conditions governing your relationship with us and should be read in conjunction with the VTVL – User Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”). All capitalized terms used in this Policy and not defined herein have the respective meanings given to them in the Terms.

The security of your personal data is important to us. At each stage of data collection, use and disclosure, the Company has in place physical, electronic, administrative and procedural safeguards to protect the personal data stored with us. However, do note that no transmission of personal data over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure – accordingly and despite our efforts, The Company cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online services. The Company shall not have any responsibility or liability for the security of information transmitted via the internet.

This Policy describes how the Company may collect, use, disclose, process and manage your personal data, and applies to any individual’s personal data which is in our possession or under our control.

## 1. What personal data is collected by the Company

"Personal data" means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified (i) from that data, or (ii) from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access. Some examples of personal data that the Company may collect are:
(a) personal particulars (e.g. name, alias(es), contact details)
(b) e-mail address;
(c) information about your use of our services and Website, and specific user interactions with the Website / Platform such as features utilised, areas visited or clicked on, and time spent;
(d) usernames and password, third party account credentials (such as your Google login credentials), Internet Protocol address (“**IP address**”), and geographical location;
(e) browser type and version, operating system used by the accessing system, internet service provider of the accessing system, the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (i.e. "referrers"), location of access, or other similar data and information;
(f) behaviour such as pages (and sub-page) visited, time and date of your visit, time spent on each page, and other diagnostic data;
(g) information or details regarding digital assets held;
(h) particulars of digital wallet addresses (including transactions performed by said digital wallet addresses), public cryptographic key relating to digital wallet addresses on distributed ledger networks and/or similar information; and/or
(i) personal opinions made known to us (e.g. feedback or responses to surveys).

Personal data may be collected when you interact with our services or use the Website, or may be received by the Company from third-party databases or service providers that provide business information.

## 2. Personal data and the Blockchain

Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called "blocks". The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several "nodes" which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.

Accordingly, by design, a blockchain’s data cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be "immutable". This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.

In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens or provision of other services) it will be necessary to collect certain personal data, such as your wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet’s private key.

The ultimate decisions to (a) transact on the blockchain using your wallet address, as well as (b) share the public key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you. **IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.**

## 3. Purposes for collection, use and disclosure of your personal data

The Company may collect, use and/or disclose your personal data for its legitimate interests or business purposes, including operations for these purposes. These may include, without limitation, the following:
